            <h4>Working on my own personal brand was a difficult one, there are so many options 
            and ways you can go it can be difficult to narrow it down. </h4><br>
            <h4>After a while going to and fro I settled on a clean modern look with a geometric
            logo and sleek lettering. Bebas Neue is possibly my favourite font and I think it 
            really worked well with the logo. I did however, like experimenting with other comical fonts.</h4><br>
            <h4>I applied the brand to a number of mockups to show how it could work across a variety of 
            mediums. </h4><br>
