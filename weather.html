		<h4>A university project, design a functioning weather app using Javascript,
		html and css.</h4><br>
		<h4>I know, everyone and their dog has designed a weather app at some point.
		So how is mine different? Well I really didn't make it to tell you the
		weather well. I made it to make you smile, even when it's raining.</h4><br>
		<h4>We were given a challenge, to design and make a weather app, to make it
		our own and to make it different. The main reason behind this project was to
		introduce us to Javascript, so while their was a large learning curve with
		this project, I really enjoyed it.</h4><br>
