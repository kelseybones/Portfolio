            <h4>A university project, design a functioning weather app using Javascript,
            html and css.</h4><br>
            <h4>I know, everyone and their dog has designed a weather app at some point.
            So how is mine different? Well I really didn't make it to tell you the
            weather well. I made it to make you smile, even when it's raining.</h4><br>
            <h4>We were given a challenge, to design and make a weather app, to make it
            our own and to make it different. The main reason behind this project was to
            introduce us to Javascript, so while their was a large learning curve with
            this project, I really enjoyed it.</h4><br>
