            <h4>Design a corporate brand, which includes, logo, font choices, colour 
            pallet, book covers and an icon set.</h4><br>
            <h4>Icon generation is not one of my strong suits but it still was a good project, 
            it introduced me to Adobe Illustrator and vectors which is an extrememly useful skill. </h4><br>
            <h4>My favourite part was creating the logo and the book covers. I loved the challenge; 
            that we had to create a selection of book covers that all fit in together as a series. 
            Part of the aim was to make people want to buy them. I felt that if the books not only had 
            cohesive covers, but rather covers that all combined to create a bigger image, that would encourage 
            people to buy the whole set to complete the image. </h4><br>
